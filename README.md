# Haskell Notes
### [Andrew Barlow](https://github.com/dandrewbarlow)

This is a repo to hold my code / notes while learning haskell. God help me.

## Resources
* [Why Haskell is Great](https://youtu.be/RqvCNb7fKsg) - Why learn haskell at all?
* [Haskell for Imperative Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe7Ei6viL6jGp1Rfu0dil1JH1SHk9bgDV) - Great video tutorial on the Haskell fundamentals, a little lacking in terms of translating those concepts into useful info (everything I've seen has been in slideshow format, which is good for teaching, less good for learning and implementing)
* [Getting Started with Haskell](https://youtu.be/fJRBeWwdby8) - More hands on tutorial with focus on beginning steps
* [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) - Free book on learning Haskell
